I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Vienna, supervised by Professor [Dominique Schröder](https://www.dominique-schroeder.de).


Research Interests
======

I am always happy to work on something that needs a clever and mathematically involved proof. It is even better if the topic is foundational to the theory of cryptography – that is usually a huge plus! Below is a non-exhaustive list of topics that I enjoy working on:

- lattice-based cryptography
- pseudorandomness and black-box reductions
- threshold signatures
